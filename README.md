# Neural-Machine-Translation

## Description
In this project my goal to build a Machine Translation model based on deep neural network .

our model consists of two part , first part is encoder which maps source-text into a vector " summarizes text's content " , which is the input to second part decoder which decodes the vector to destination-text .
